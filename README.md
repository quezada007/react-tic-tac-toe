# React Tic Tac Toe Game

This is the React Tic Tac Toe game from the tutorial in [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)'s site but with my own twist in the implementation.


### Getting Started
Open Terminal and install all the Node Modules needed by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start development, run the following command on your Terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

To view your project, open the browser to http://localhost:8080

### Production

If you just want to compile SCSS and JS without running the watch or live reloading, just run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Unit Testing

To run all of your unit testing, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
